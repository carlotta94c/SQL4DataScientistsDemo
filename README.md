# SQL for Data Scientists Demo

Demo material for Microsoft Reactor session "Getting Started with Databases: SQL and Data Visualizations".

Let's imagine that we are a Swedish Italian Wine and Chocolate company that would like to start selling wine and chocolate packages. Before launching our products on the market, we wish to analyze competitors' data. In this demo we are going to use Rsqlite and the tidyverse framework to explore and visualize our data.

You can recreate the demo in the session using the steps outlined below.

## Running the demo notebook

You can run the demo R notebook with zero set-up, by using the dev container image provided in this repo.

If you have access to GitHub CodeSpaces, click the green "<> Code" button at the top right on this repository page, and then select "Create codespace on main". (GitHub CodeSpaces is available with [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste) and [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste)). Then, browse to the file [Rsqlite and tidymodels demo.ipynb](Rsqlite%20and%20tidymodels%20demo.ipynb). Work through the Jupyter Notebook.

Otherwise, you can access the code locally, by cloning this repo, launching Visual Studio Code, and open the directory containing this downloaded repository. To execute it, open the VS Code command palette (Control-Shift-P) and run the command **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**. The first time you try this, you will need to wait a few minutes for the container to build. After this first time, startup will be near-instantaneous. Now, browse to the file [Rsqlite and tidymodels demo.ipynb](Rsqlite%20and%20tidymodels%20demo.ipynb). Work through the Jupyter Notebook.

You can use Linux, Mac or Windows. Just make sure your machine has the following necessary software installed:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste), and the [Remote-Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads?WT.mc_id=academic-70545-cacaste)
